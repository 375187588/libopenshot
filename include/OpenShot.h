/**
 * \mainpage OpenShot Video Editing Library C++ API
 *
 * Welcome to the OpenShot Video Editing Library C++ API.  This library is a video editing and animation
 * framework, which powers the <a href="http://www.openshot.org">OpenShot Video Editor</a> application.
 * It can also be used to power your next C++ video editing project!  It is very powerful, supporting many
 * different framerate mapping conversions as well as many different keyframe interpolation methods, such
 * as Bezier curves, Linear, and Constant.
 *
 * All you need is a single <b>include</b> to get started:
 * \code
 * #include "OpenShot.h"
 * \endcode

 * Please read this documentation to learn all about how the OpenShot Video Editing Library works, and how
 * you can use it on your next video editing application.
