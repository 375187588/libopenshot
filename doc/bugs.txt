These are the known bugs in the OpenShot Library
-------------------------------------------------
1) (CRITICAL) FFmpegReader - Issues with audio continuity and GetAudioPTSLocation(). For some reason, there are skipped
   audio samples, gaps in PTS timecodes, and generally "Poppy" and "Crackly" audio in WebM files. WebM files
   seem to have more audio issues than other codecs, for some reason.
2) (CRITICAL) FFmpegReader - Issues with OpenMP and the nested ImageMagick++ OpenMP implementation. On my 8 core system,
   If I don't call omp_set_num_threads(4... or less), an ImageMagick++ error is raised. I have posted this 
   issue on the ImageMagick forum: http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=24036
3) (CRITICAL) FFmpegReader - OpenMP issue if more tasks are created than the number of processors. For example, on 
   ReadStream(), if minimum_packets = 8 and omp_set_num_threads(4), than potentially more than 4 tasks will
   be running at the same time, and some tasks just seem to disappear (or never actually start).
